Today I learned about implementing terinary operators in Redux to control what renders when. I had an issue where it was trying to render a search prop before the page would successfully load and throw an error that search was undefined only when i would try to target the objects value. With a terinary operation, you can use "if this prop is available, render what you want, else do nothing" so then the render would wait for the prop to be accessable.
