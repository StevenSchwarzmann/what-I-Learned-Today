Today I learned about CSS LESS files and how they function. I also gained a better understanding of how actions, reducers, and stores function together in Redux applications. Although I gained a better insight, I realize there is still a lot to learn before understanding Redux better. I hope to resolve most of these "grey areas" later this week.
