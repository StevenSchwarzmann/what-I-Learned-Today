Today I wrapped up my Weather App with only one small onClick function to add left. I was introduced to the moment node module today which was used in my History component of my weather to tell the user when the api call was used. I also learned how to convert a code given by the weather API into an image of the weather status. I attended a forum today that covered ES6 let & const that was a good refresher as well.
