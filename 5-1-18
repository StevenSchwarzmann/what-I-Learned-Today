Today I worked more into my Weather App and starting to feel comfortable with my props and displaying info from my API. I was struggling with getting my city to append to URL but realized it was because named "cityInput" in my main component. My current blocker is that I am struggling to get my wind speed to display in my City info component because it is an object with more than one property. I plan to work on this tomorrow and start working on my search bar component.
